## THIS IS A SAMPLE SCHEDULE that shows how arbitrary schedules can be built.
## Sample differently on three days of the week - Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
## On Monday we take photos every minute from 3am to 6am.
## On Wednesday, take photos from 7pm to 10pm every 2nd minute.
## On Friday, take a studio photo every minute from 11pm to 2am (which is Saturday morning)
## ...and take an audio sample once every 5 minutes in the same time window.
